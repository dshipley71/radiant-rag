# View HTML Pages on GitHub

You can render and view HTML files from a GitHub repository directly in your browser without downloading them. Here are the most reliable methods.

---

## 1. GitHub Pages

**Best for:** Long-term hosting, static websites with linked CSS/JS files

1. Go to your repository's **Settings → Pages** section
2. Under **Source**, select the branch containing your HTML file (commonly `main` or `master`) and set the folder to `/root` or `/docs` depending on where your HTML file is stored
3. Click **Save** — GitHub will generate a public URL:
   ```
   https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/
   ```
4. Ensure your main HTML file is named `index.html` so it loads automatically

> ℹ️ This method works for public repositories and supports linked CSS/JS files, making it ideal for hosting static websites.

## 2. Raw.githack.com

**Best for:** Quick previews of single HTML files

1. Open your HTML file in GitHub and click the **Raw** button
2. Copy the URL from the address bar
3. Go to [raw.githack.com](https://raw.githack.com) and paste the copied URL into the input box
4. Use the generated **Production** link to view the rendered HTML in your browser

## 3. htmlpreview.github.io

**Best for:** Instant previews without any setup

1. Open your HTML file on GitHub and copy its URL (the one with `/blob/`)
2. In your browser, prepend the preview service URL:
   ```
   https://htmlpreview.github.io/?<paste-your-URL-here>
   ```

**Example:**
```
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/user/repo/blob/main/index.html
```

This will render the HTML directly in a new tab.
